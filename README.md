# Fake News Detector

## Project Dcescription
The goal of this project is to create a model using machine learning that can determine whether an article is fake news or not. To interact with this model, a web page will be created that will allow a user to enter a article title/paragraph/URL and have the model determine whether that specific article is fake news or real news. An analysis will also be conducted to see what the characteristics of a fake news article are and compare to the characteristic of real news article and help make fake news more identifiable.

## Motivation
Fake news has become an issue in todayâ€™s climate, especially with the prevalence of social media and easily shareable content. Fake news can often spread quickly and can be taken as fact when it is bias and/or opiniated. It is also sometimes difficult/time consuming to determine what is fake news or not. This is why we have decided explore what makes fake news, fake news and how to distinguish it from real news.
